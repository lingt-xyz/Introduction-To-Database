The ENCS usernames in this group are

   *

You have been given the "group account" * to do your project work
for this course. "group accounts" are needed so that you can share files
with your partners easily.

2 email aliases have been setup for your group. Sending email to either
*@encs.concordia.ca or *@encs.concordia.ca will send email
to each one of you.

Though you have a group account you do not have to login to it. You have
been added to the "*" unix group and you can write in the following
directories:


  /groups/q/*       This directory is where you should cd into
                               and use while working on the project.
                               It is *NOT* available on the web server!


  /www/groups/q/*   This is the directory where you should place
                               *ALL* the files to be viewable on the web.


You as a user do not have any disk quota on the above directories but the
unix group "*" does. The above directories have the sgid bit set
(the 's' in 'rws' below) which means that any files or directories created
below these ones will automatically belong to the "*" group

 permissions     owner       group        location
  drwxrws---    *   *      /groups/q/*
  dr-xrws---    nul-web    *      /www/groups/q/*

(The web server initially runs as "nul-web" before switching to "*".)


If you change the permissions of any directory under these make sure that
the 's' bit is on (use "chmod g+s name_of_subdirectory" to do so). If you
ever get a message that you are over quota please check the permissions of
the directory you are trying to write into.

You can run the command "mysql" on any linux machine in the faculty.

The User ID  for web access is *
The password for web access is *

The base URL for your web pages is

  https://*.encs.concordia.ca/

Note: it is https not http! The web server will automatically redirect
     to https if the URL starts with http.


As an example you can create a foo.php in /www/groups/q/*
that contains:

<HTML>
<HEAD>
 <TITLE>Date/Time Functions Demo</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>Date/Time Functions Demo</H1>
<P>The current date and time is
<EM><?echo date("D M d, Y H:i:s", time())?></EM>
</BODY>
</HTML>

Using the URL https://*.encs.concordia.ca/foo.php
you would see something like

   Date/Time Functions Demo

   The current date and time is Tue Jan 16, 2018 10:13:43
